# tic-tac-toe

Find the game here - <https://nitya2602.github.io/tic-tac-toe/>

There are 4 versions of this game that we have implemented:
* 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe - Works fine
* 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe - Needs improvement
* 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe - Needs improvement
* Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe - Works fine

The algorithm that works absolutely fine for 3x3 board, gives problem when used for 4x4 and 5x5 board.
It leads to page becoming unresponsive when used for difficult levels. We are in the process of improving it.
